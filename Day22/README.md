# 1️⃣ Time Complexity

## 🔹 What is Big-O?
Big-O notation describes the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm.

### Common Complexities:
| Complexity | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant Time |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic |
| O(n) | Linear |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic |
| O(n²) | Quadratic |
